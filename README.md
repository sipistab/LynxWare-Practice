# LynxWare-Practice

Preface
I am convinced I was delivered onto a keyboard. I hate the institute of the mouse with a burning passion. That being said more and more applications I have to work with rely heavily on the mouse without offering keyboard alternatives. Hell is not fire and brimstone, it is in the time wasted with moving my hand from the keyboard to the mouse and back. Here comes this buzz-cut german guy with Lynxware, my personal saviour. Now I have a keyboard for a mouse. Check it out: Lynxware.

I experiment a lot with the layout, I use different layouts for different workflows and for gaming, so as I tinker I get a bit sluggish with muscle memory, so I built this trainer. If you are new to touch typing 10 fingers... are you?! How did you find this repo?

Anyway, this is just a short terminal script aimed to be easy to use.

Purpose
The goal is to help users develop muscle memory and improve their touch typing skills on the Lynx specifically. There is a scoring system in place so the user can game their efficiency.

How to Use the App
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from Python's official website.
Usage Instructions
Download the application folder:

On Windows, run the bash script "LynxPractice.bat".
On MacOS, run the shell script "LynxPractice.sh".
On Linux, I expect you to know how to run a Python script.
Starting a Practice Session:

When prompted, press ENTER to start the session.
The program will display a random character for you to type.
Type the character correctly as prompted.
During the Practice Session:

The program will indicate if your input is correct with "GOOD!".
If the input is incorrect, it will show "BAD! TRY: [character]" and count a fault.
Ending the Session:

The session will automatically end when all characters have been tested.
The program will display your session time, number of faults, and your score.
To end the practice, type 'SUBMIT' when prompted.
Important Notes
Character Set:

The trainer includes a specific set of characters to practice: "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "k", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "j", "l", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z".
You can add to, remove, or change any of these letters if your layout is different. It probably is.
Future Development:

This application is a work in progress. Further development and enhancements will be added over time. If you have suggestions or encounter issues, feel free to let me know.
